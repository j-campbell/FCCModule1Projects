          <ul><lh>Abilities</lh>
            <li><span class="li-nb">Superior Human Conditioning:</span> Snake was revealed to be genetically-engineered from birth along with his twin brother, then received further rigorous training from youth to adulthood. This makes him more stronger, faster, agile, resilient, and smarter to the maximum ability of what a human can do.</li>
            <li><span class="li-nb">High-Level Intelligence:</span> Possessing an IQ of 180 and fluent in six languages, Snake is far from a gun toting thug. His perceptive and crafty nature has won him battles against opponents who would otherwise overwhelm him in a battle of strength and artillery.</li>
            <li><span class="li-nb">Advanced Military Operator/Extensive Military Training:</span> He has spent time with both the Green Berets during the Gulf War of 1991 and the elite-FOXHOUND unit, where he trained under Big Boss himself and learned CQC (Close Quarters Combat). If you can think of a piece of military equipment, Snake has probably operated it at some point, including a railgun.</li>
            <li><span class="li-nb">Master Marksman:</span> Snake is highly skilled with various firearms such as Handguns, Shotguns, Sub machine guns, assault rifles, Machine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers.</li>
            <li><span class="li-nb">Master Spy:</span> He has infiltrated multiple heavily armed strongholds from military bases in the Middle Eastern mountains, to the Alaskan arctic, to even cruise liners, with no weapons or gear, picking up equipment on-site while avoiding alert and capture, even being able to sneak around in makeshift items such as cardboard boxes.</li>
            <li><span class="li-nb">Master Tactician:</span> Snake is a highly skilled planner. He is able to infiltrate and escape enemy facilities, disguise himself as another person or object, and exploit an opponent's weakness.</li>
